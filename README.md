# Cash Register

This project simulates a cash register app that should accept $20, $10, $5, $2 and $1 bills. It supports putting money
into the register and taking it out, as shown below. When asked to provide change of a given amount, return the change
as the number of bills that should be given from the cash register. If you canâ€™t make exact change, it throws a
RuntimeExeption.
